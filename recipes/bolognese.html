		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>Bolognese is a meat-based sauce in Italian cuisine, typical of the city of Bologna. It is customarily used to dress tagliatelle al ragù and to prepare lasagne alla bolognese.</p>
		<h4>Ingredients</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
			<li>1 cup finely diced onion</li>
			<li>½ cup finely diced celery</li>
			<li>½ cup finely diced carrot</li>
			<li>1 pinch salt</li>
			<li>1 ½ pounds ground beef</li>
			<li>salt</li>
			<li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
			<li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
			<li>⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
			<li>1 ½ cups 2% milk</li>
			<li>2 cups white wine</li>
			<li>1 (28 ounce) can whole Italian plum tomatoes (preferably San Marzano)</li>
			<li>2 cups water, or as needed</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Steps</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Melt butter with olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook onion, celery, and carrot with pinch of salt until onion turns translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir ground beef into vegetables and cook, stirring constantly until meat is crumbly and no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Season meat mixture with 1 1/2 teaspoon salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and nutmeg.</li>
			<li>Pour milk into ground beef mixture and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring often, until most of the milk has evaporated and bottom of pan is still slightly saucy, about 5 minutes.</li>
			<li>Raise heat to medium high and pour white wine into ground beef mixture; cook and stir until white wine has mostly evaporated, about 5 more minutes.</li>
			<li>Pour tomatoes with juice into a large mixing bowl and crush them with your fingers until they resemble a slightly chunky sauce. Pour tomatoes into sauce; fill can with 2 cups water and add to sauce. Bring to a simmer.</li>
			<li>Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring often, until mixture cooks down into a thick sauce, at least 3 hours but preferably 4 to 6 hours. Skim fat from top of sauce if desired. If sauce is too thick or too hot on the bottom, add a little more water. Taste and adjust seasonings before serving.</li>
